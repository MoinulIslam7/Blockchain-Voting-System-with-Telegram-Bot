Blockchain Network: Ethereum or any compatible network for deploying the smart contract.

Ethers.js: Facilitates communication between the Telegram bot and the blockchain.

Tools:
Node.js: Ensure you have Node.js installed.
Telegraf.js: Install Telegraf.js for building the Telegram bot.
Truffle: A development framework for Ethereum.
Ganache: A local blockchain for testing.
Ethers.js: A JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
